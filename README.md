# html-basics

HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the language common to every website. 
HTML describes the basic structure and content of a web page. 
If you want to build a website or web application, you'll need to know HTML. This page was built as a practice exercise for a VR Blog without CSS (future implementation).


## Take-aways:

* Semantic markup
* Formatting page content
* Understanding file paths
* Displaying images
* Inline vs. block level elements
